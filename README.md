# RuneHelper

**RuneHelper** is a tool for analyzing the in-game economy of [RuneScape](http://www.runescape.com/), an online multiplayer videogame. In RuneScape, the Grand Exchange is an in-game marketplace that serves as the center of the game's economy, where players buy and sell all items in the game. Like a real economy, supply and demand heavily dictates the prices of items in the Grand Exchange, which can be dependant on both in-game and real world events. RuneHelper uses years of historical data from the Grand Exchange in combination with RuneScape's official API to help the player analyze trends in the RuneScape market over tens of thousands of items, so that the player can make the best game decisions possible.

RuneHelper is written in R, and utilizes the [Shiny web framework](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) to create the application's interface. The R packages [Dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr), [purrr](https://github.com/tidyverse/purrr), [jsonlite](https://github.com/jeroen/jsonlite), and [httr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html) are used for data collection and manipulation. Data visualization is performed using [Plotly](https://plot.ly/r/).

## Item Price Chart

RuneHelper's item price chart allows the player to understand and visualize the market trends of any of RuneScape's tens of thousands of items. Historical price information is shown graphically, and users can manipulate the chart to better examine particular data ranges or specific data points. Also generated is an information box providing useful economic data, such as the item's current price, and percentage in price change over the last 30/90/180 days.

**Example usage:** Below is a screenshot of RuneHelper viewing the economic data for the Santa Hat, a very rare and valuable item that is typically in high demand around Christmas time each year. One might initially guess that the price of the Santa Hat would increase in the days just before Christmas due to increasing demand. However, using RuneHelper, we can see that each year the price of the Santa Hat typically peaks in early December. Once Christmas is over, the item decreases in price until around mid-February. Using this analysis generated by RuneHelper, the player can determine that they can make the most profit by purchasing the Santa Hat in mid-Feburary and selling it in early December.

## Economy Statistics

RuneHelper also provides useful information about the collective RuneScape economy and its sub-categories. New updates to the game often often cause huge categories of items to drastically shift in price. Players can use the statistics and charts generated by RuneHelper to predict how upcoming updates will impact the game's economy, and use this information to make profits based on announced, future updates to the game.

**Example usage:** Below is a screenshot of RuneHelper viewing the averaged price of all the in-game weapons over time. We can see that the average weapon price increased quite drastically in December of 2012, a result of a massive update released for RuneScape in November of 2012 that overhauled the game's combat. Economically-wise players can use this information to their advantage; if RuneScape announces a future update to their combat system, one could stand to make quite a profit by stocking up on weapons before the update.

## About

RuneHelper was developed by Kyle Evans in 2016. Historical market data on the Grand Exchange was downloaded from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/Nixonite/Runescape-Grand-Exchange-Market-Data), then cleaned up to best fit the needs of the projects.
